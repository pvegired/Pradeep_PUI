This folder includes

3 html files each for homepage, product browsing page, product detail page
and once style.css file.

Extra Work that I did:
1. Added picking assistant page as well
2. Used flexbox for responsive site, yet to work more on wrapping though
3. Read a blog about writing alt text and followed it religiously https://supercooldesign.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-good-alt-text
